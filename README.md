Presenting to you, Bombs and Boosters, a modern twist to a classic household game, Snakes and Ladders.

## How to play?
1. Firstly, you are given the option to select how many players are going to be playing the game. The range varies from 2 to 4.
2. Then instead of predetermined location of the bombs, you are given the freedom to choose the position of the bombs, so you can place wherever you feel like the bomb will be the most effective. 
3. Landing on a bomb will push you behind. Beware that a bomb that a player places will blow up if they step on it too.
4. There are also randomly placed boosters which are invisible to the players. Landing on them will boost the players forward.
5. When it’s the player’s turn, they are given a dice to roll and depending on the dice result the player moves that many steps forward.
6. First player to reach 100 wins the game.
